Question 1.
The following problem is on the backend regarding address_ship and delivery_service. 
According to my assumption, assuming the development scheme is monolithic an error occurred in processing the query and calling the function from the query. 
The solution is to run the transaction, then if the transaction is successful then i will look at the database, if it doesn't match i will check the log that is reversing the transaction id, then i will try to replicate it in the staging environment or production environment with the same transaction scenario whether an anomaly occurs or not.
